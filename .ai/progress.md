## Step 3: Frontend Foundation

## Date: 2025-09-01

### Step 3.1: Set Up Routing & Base Layout

- Implemented Angular routing with routes for login, register, dashboard, time-entry, projects, clients, and vacations.
- Created LayoutComponent with Material toolbar for navigation and router-outlet for child routes.
- Verified navigation between routes and layout rendering.

### Step 3.2: Implement Authentication Flow

- Created LoginComponent and RegisterComponent using Angular Reactive Forms.
- Added AuthService for backend API integration (login/register endpoints).
- Implemented JWT token storage in localStorage and redirection after auth.
- Verified user registration, login, and UI role-based access setup.

### Step 3.3: Implement Time Entry UI

- Created TimeEntryComponent with reactive form for manual time entry (project, client, start/end time, description).
- Added list display for recent time entries using \*ngFor.
- Verified form validation, submission, and list updates.

### Step 3.4: Implement Project/Client Management UI

- Created ProjectsComponent and ClientsComponent with basic forms for CRUD operations.
- Verified component rendering and user assignment placeholders.

### Step 3.5: Implement Vacation Days UI

- Created VacationsComponent with placeholders for vacation balance and calendar view.
- Verified component rendering for employee and HR roles.

All Step 3 tests validated. Ready for Step 4.

## Step 4: State Management & API Integration

## Date: 2025-09-01

### Step 4.1: Set Up NgRx SignalStore for User, TimeEntry, Project, Vacation State

- Created `auth.store.ts` for authentication state management (login, register, logout, token handling).
- Created `time-entry.store.ts` for time entry CRUD operations.
- Created `project.store.ts` for project and client management.
- Created `vacation.store.ts` for vacation request management.
- All stores use NgRx SignalStore with reactive state updates, loading states, and error handling.
- Verified state updates by dispatching actions and checking store state.

### Step 4.2: Connect UI to Backend APIs

- Updated `login.component.ts` and `register.component.ts` to use `AuthStore` for authentication flows.
- Updated `time-entry.component.ts` to use `TimeEntryStore` and `ProjectStore` for creating and listing time entries, connected to backend APIs.
- Updated `projects.component.ts` to use `ProjectStore` for project CRUD operations.
- Added HTTP interceptor (`auth.interceptor.ts`) to automatically include JWT tokens in API requests.
- Configured the interceptor in `app.config.ts`.
- Adjusted models and services to match backend expectations (e.g., sending full `Project` and `Client` objects).
- Verified CRUD operations from the UI update the database correctly.

All Step 4 tests validated. Ready for Step 5.

---

## Step 5: Basic Dashboard

## Date: 2025-09-02

### Step 5.1: Implement Dashboard View

- Employees: Implemented dashboard showing summary of total hours tracked (calculated from time entry durations), recent time entries (last 5), and vacation balance (from user profile).
- HR: Implemented dashboard showing overview of all employees with report status for the current month ("Reported" or "Not Reported" based on time entries in the month).
- Added sample data loader (`DataLoader.java`) to insert test users, clients, projects, time entries, and vacation days on application startup.
- Updated time entry form with pre-selected date (today), separate date picker, and time inputs for better usability.
- Enhanced clients component with form to add new clients and list existing ones.
- Verified dashboard updates with time entry logging and HR report status visibility.

All Step 5 tests validated. Ready for Step 6.

## Step 6: Testing & Validation

## Date: 2025-09-02

### Step 6.1: Backend Testing Implementation

- **Test Framework Setup**: Configured JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test, and JaCoCo for comprehensive backend testing.
- **Repository Tests**: Created `TimeEntryRepositoryTest.java` with tests for CRUD operations, custom queries, and data integrity.
- **Controller Tests**: Implemented `AuthControllerTest.java` and `TimeEntryControllerTest.java` with MockMvc for API endpoint testing.
- **Security Testing**: Added JWT authentication and role-based access control tests.
- **Coverage Analysis**: Achieved >70% test coverage with JaCoCo reporting.
- **Database Integration**: Used H2 in-memory database for isolated test environments.

### Step 6.2: Frontend Testing Migration & Implementation

- **Initial Challenges**: Encountered Zone.js/Karma conflicts with Angular 20's zoneless change detection, causing NG0908 errors.
- **Framework Migration**: Successfully migrated from Karma to Vitest for better Angular 20 compatibility.
- **Test Configuration**:
  - Created `vitest.config.ts` with Angular plugin support
  - Updated `test-setup.ts` for Vitest compatibility
  - Modified package.json scripts for Vitest execution
- **Test Implementation**:
  - `AuthService` tests: Login/register API calls with HttpClientTestingModule
  - `AuthStore` tests: State management, computed signals, and async operations
  - `AppComponent` tests: Basic component rendering
  - `LoginComponent` tests: Form validation, auth integration, and routing
- **Async Testing**: Converted deprecated `done()` callbacks to promise-based patterns
- **Mock Setup**: Updated from Jasmine spies to Vitest's `vi.fn()` for better compatibility

### Step 6.3: Test Results & Validation

- **Backend Tests**: All 11 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- **Frontend Tests**: All 5 tests passing after Vitest migration
- **Total Coverage**: 16/16 tests passing across both applications
- **Performance**: Vitest provides faster execution (~1.45s vs ~3-4s with Karma)
- **Compatibility**: Resolved Angular 20 Zone.js conflicts through modern testing framework

### Step 6.4: Testing Architecture Insights

- **Backend Testing Strategy**:

  - Unit tests for repositories and services
  - Integration tests for controllers with MockMvc
  - Security-focused tests for authentication flows
  - Database isolation using H2 for reliable test execution

- **Frontend Testing Strategy**:

  - Component tests with TestBed and RouterTestingModule
  - Service tests with HttpClientTestingModule
  - Store tests with reactive state validation
  - Async operation testing with promises and error handling

- **CI/CD Integration**: Tests run automatically in GitHub Actions for both frontend and backend
- **Coverage Reporting**: JaCoCo for backend, Vitest coverage for frontend
